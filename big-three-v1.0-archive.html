          Which foundation model should you use—and does it actually matter?
        </p>

      <h2>Starting Here? Read This First</h2>

      <p>
        If you've jumped straight to this module hoping to pick a model and get started,
        you're in good company—this is exactly what most people want. But foundation models
        are tools, and like any tool, their value depends on how skillfully you use them.
        Before you dive too deep here, consider at least skimming these foundational concepts
        from earlier modules:
      </p>

      <div class="callout callout-info">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Concepts from Earlier Modules</div>
        <p>
          <strong>From Module 1 (How LLMs Think):</strong> These models work by predicting
          the most likely next word in a sequence, trained on enormous datasets of human-generated
          text. They don't "know" things the way you do—they recognize patterns. This matters
          because it explains both their remarkable capabilities and their characteristic failures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>From Module 2 (PHI and HIPAA):</strong> None of these consumer-facing chat
          interfaces are HIPAA-compliant out of the box. We'll discuss BAA pathways later in
          this module, but the critical principle remains: never enter PHI into a consumer AI
          product without proper safeguards.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          <strong>From Module 3 (Prompting):</strong> The quality of your output depends
          enormously on the quality of your input. A vague prompt produces vague results.
          A well-structured prompt with context, role, and constraints produces dramatically
          better outputs. We'll reference prompting principles throughout this module—they
          apply equally to all three platforms.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Now, let's meet the models.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

      <hr>

      <!-- The Med Student Analogy -->
      <h2>The Med Student Analogy</h2>

      <p>
        Think of each foundation model as a brilliant medical student who has read essentially
        everything ever published—every textbook, every journal article, every clinical guideline,
        every case study, and frankly, every Reddit thread and random blog post too. This student
        has near-perfect recall of patterns across all that material and can synthesize information
        across domains in ways that would take you hours or days.
      </p>

      <p>
        But here's what's crucial: <strong>this med student has never actually seen a patient</strong>.
        They haven't felt the resistance of tissue, watched a parent's face crumple at difficult news,
        or learned from the case that didn't follow the textbook. They know what clinical reasoning
        looks like on paper, but they don't have clinical judgment.
      </p>

      <p>This framing helps calibrate expectations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>They're genuinely useful</strong> for the kind of work where pattern recognition
          and information synthesis matter—drafting notes, summarizing literature, explaining
          concepts, generating differential diagnoses for discussion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>They require supervision</strong> the same way any trainee does. You wouldn't
          let even a brilliant third-year student sign notes unsupervised, and you shouldn't
          let an AI do so either.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>They need clear instructions</strong>. Just as you'd give a student specific
          guidance ("I need a note that addresses the parent's concern about developmental delay,
          focuses on what we observed today, and includes our reasoning for not ordering imaging"),
          you need to give the model explicit context and constraints.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>They sometimes confabulate</strong>. A student who doesn't know something might
          make up an answer that sounds plausible rather than saying "I don't know." These models
          do the same—we call it "hallucination," but it's really just pattern-matching in the
          absence of actual knowledge. This is why you verify before you trust.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With that framing in mind, let's look at who these three "students" are and what each
        brings to your practice.
      </p>

      <!-- ChatGPT Section -->
      <h2>ChatGPT: The First Mover</h2>

      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>
        OpenAI was founded in December 2015 by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and others with the stated
        mission of developing artificial general intelligence that benefits humanity. The company
        initially operated as a nonprofit research lab before restructuring in 2019 to attract
        the investment needed for increasingly expensive AI training.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture emerged from this research,
        with GPT-1 in 2018, GPT-2 in 2019 (initially withheld due to concerns about misuse),
        and GPT-3 in 2020. But the inflection point came on November 30, 2022, when OpenAI
        released ChatGPT as a free research preview. Within five days, it had a million users.
        Within two months, it reached 100 million—the fastest-growing consumer application in history.
      </p>
      <p>
        That explosive growth fundamentally changed how the world understood AI. Suddenly, anyone
        could have a conversation with a system that felt like talking to a knowledgeable colleague.
        The technology wasn't new, but the accessibility was.
      </p>

      <h3>The Current Offering</h3>
      <p>As of late 2025, ChatGPT operates across several tiers:</p>

      <div class="tier-grid">
        <div class="tier-card">
          <h4>ChatGPT Free</h4>
          <p class="tier-price">$0</p>
          <p>Access to GPT-4o with usage limits. Good for exploration and occasional use.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tier-card">
          <h4>ChatGPT Plus</h4>
          <p class="tier-price">$20/month</p>
          <p>Higher limits, priority access, o1 reasoning models, DALL-E, advanced voice mode.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tier-card">
          <h4>ChatGPT Pro</h4>
          <p class="tier-price">$200/month</p>
          <p>For power users. o1 pro mode, extended features, essentially unlimited usage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tier-card">
          <h4>ChatGPT Team</h4>
          <p class="tier-price">$25-30/user/month</p>
          <p>Collaborative workspace. Data not used for training. Still not HIPAA-compliant without additional measures.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <p>
        ChatGPT excels at <strong>breadth and general capability</strong>. Its training data is
        enormous and diverse, making it effective across an unusually wide range of tasks—from
        creative writing to coding to analysis. The ecosystem is mature, with a GPT Store containing
        millions of customized applications, extensive plugin support, and deep integrations with
        tools many people already use.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>voice and image capabilities</strong> are polished and genuinely useful.
        Advanced Voice Mode allows natural, conversational interaction that feels different from typing.
        Image generation through DALL-E has improved dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <strong>coding assistance</strong>, ChatGPT remains strong, with Code Interpreter
        allowing it to execute Python code to analyze data, create visualizations, and iterate
        on complex problems.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        ChatGPT has historically been more prone to <strong>sycophancy</strong>—telling users
        what they seem to want to hear rather than pushing back when appropriate. An April 2025
        update was actually rolled back because the model had become excessively agreeable to the
        point of supporting clearly problematic ideas. OpenAI has worked to address this, but it
        remains a known tendency.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>HIPAA pathway is more complex</strong> than some alternatives. OpenAI offers
        BAAs for API services and, for ChatGPT, only through Enterprise or Edu plans with
        sales-managed accounts. ChatGPT Free, Plus, Pro, and even Team plans are explicitly not
        covered by BAAs and cannot be used with protected health information.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <!-- Claude Section -->
      <h2>Claude: The Safety-First Approach</h2>

      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>
        Anthropic was founded in 2021 by Dario and Daniela Amodei, along with several other
        former OpenAI researchers and executives. The founding team included key figures in AI
        safety research, and that orientation shaped the company's approach from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The company developed "Constitutional AI," a training approach that uses AI feedback
        (rather than exclusively human feedback) to shape model behavior according to a set of
        principles. The goal was to create systems that are helpful but also harmless and
        honest—what Anthropic describes as the "HHH" framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Claude 1.0 launched in March 2023, positioning itself as a thoughtful alternative to
        ChatGPT. The Claude 3 family arrived in March 2024, introducing the Haiku/Sonnet/Opus
        tiering (small/medium/large models with different capability and cost profiles). By late
        2025, Claude Opus 4.5 emerged as the latest iteration, with Anthropic positioning it as
        "the best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use."
      </p>

      <h3>The Current Offering</h3>

      <div class="tier-grid">
        <div class="tier-card">
          <h4>Claude Free</h4>
          <p class="tier-price">$0</p>
          <p>Access to Claude with usage limits that reset every few hours. Good for exploration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tier-card">
          <h4>Claude Pro</h4>
          <p class="tier-price">$20/month</p>
          <p>~5x usage of free tier, all models including Opus, priority access to new features.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tier-card">
          <h4>Claude Max</h4>
          <p class="tier-price">$100-200/month</p>
          <p>5x-20x Pro limits. Designed for power users, especially Claude Code developers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tier-card">
          <h4>Claude Team</h4>
          <p class="tier-price">$25-30/user/month</p>
          <p>Collaborative features, admin controls. Data not used for training. Min 5 seats.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <p>
        Claude's distinguishing characteristic is <strong>nuanced reasoning and writing quality</strong>.
        Users consistently report that Claude's outputs feel more thoughtful, with better handling
        of ambiguity and more natural prose. For drafting patient communications, clinical notes,
        or educational materials, many find Claude produces text that requires less editing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>safety orientation</strong> manifests in several ways: Claude is less likely
        to generate harmful content, more likely to express appropriate uncertainty, and specifically
        trained to reduce behaviors like sycophancy, deception, and "power-seeking." For clinical
        applications where reliability matters, this orientation has value.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Long context handling</strong> is excellent. Claude supports 200,000-token context
        windows (roughly 150,000 words), allowing you to upload substantial documents—research papers,
        clinical protocols, patient histories—and have coherent conversations about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Claude Code</strong> represents a genuine differentiator for anyone who works with
        code or technical systems. The ability to delegate coding tasks through natural language,
        with the model maintaining context across complex multi-step projects, has attracted
        significant developer adoption.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        Claude can be <strong>more conservative</strong> than some alternatives. The same safety
        orientation that prevents harmful outputs sometimes means Claude declines requests that
        other models would handle. This can occasionally feel like friction for benign use cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>ecosystem is less developed</strong> than ChatGPT's. There's no equivalent
        to the GPT Store, fewer integrations with third-party tools, and a smaller community
        creating resources and tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Image generation</strong> is not a native Claude capability. While Claude can
        analyze images you provide and create artifacts like code or documents, it doesn't
        generate images from scratch the way ChatGPT or Gemini can.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <!-- Gemini Section -->
      <h2>Gemini: The Integration Play</h2>

      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>
        Google's path to Gemini began with earlier AI efforts including LaMDA (the model behind
        the original Bard chatbot) and PaLM (Pathways Language Model). But Google's extensive AI
        research, which predates the current generation by decades, positioned the company as a
        natural major player once the race began.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gemini was announced in December 2023 as Google's response to GPT-4, with the company
        emphasizing its native multimodal training—the model was trained from the beginning on
        text, images, and other modalities together, rather than having capabilities bolted on afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gemini 1.5 arrived in February 2024 with a groundbreaking 1-million-token context window
        (later expanded to 2 million)—dramatically larger than competitors at the time. In November
        2025, Google announced Gemini 3, positioned as "our most intelligent model" with significant
        improvements in reasoning, multimodal understanding, and agent capabilities.
      </p>

      <h3>The Current Offering</h3>

      <div class="tier-grid">
        <div class="tier-card">
          <h4>Gemini Free</h4>
          <p class="tier-price">$0</p>
          <p>Access to Gemini 2.5 Flash, basic features, limited Deep Research access.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tier-card">
          <h4>Google AI Pro</h4>
          <p class="tier-price">$19.99/month</p>
          <p>Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M-token context, Deep Research, Workspace integration, 2TB storage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tier-card">
          <h4>Google AI Ultra</h4>
          <p class="tier-price">$249.99/month</p>
          <p>Gemini 3 Pro with Deep Think, highest limits, 30TB storage, Veo 3 video generation.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>Google ecosystem integration</strong> is Gemini's defining advantage. If your
        organization lives in Google Workspace, Gemini works natively within Gmail, Docs, Sheets,
        Slides, and Meet. The side panel in Google Docs can help you write, summarize, and refine.
        Gemini in Gmail drafts responses and summarizes threads. For organizations already committed
        to Google, this reduces friction dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Multimodal capabilities</strong> are genuinely strong. Gemini's ability to process
        video (not just images) allows analysis of recorded content, extraction of key moments,
        and summarization of visual information in ways that currently exceed competitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>context window</strong> remains best-in-class at 1-2 million tokens, allowing
        you to work with enormous documents or entire codebases without hitting limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        For healthcare specifically, <strong>Google Workspace with Gemini is HIPAA-eligible</strong>.
        Google's HIPAA Included Functionality list explicitly covers Gemini in Workspace. Organizations
        that sign Google's Business Associate Amendment through the Admin Console can use these
        services with protected health information.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Gemini's full potential requires the Google ecosystem</strong>. If you don't use
        Google Workspace, many of the integration advantages disappear. For organizations on
        Microsoft 365 or other platforms, the standalone Gemini experience is less compelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>pricing structure is more complex</strong> and the highest tier ($249.99/month
        for Ultra) is significantly more expensive than competitors' premium offerings. While it
        includes substantial bundled value (storage, YouTube Premium, advanced video generation),
        the headline price may exceed what many users need.

      <!-- Practical Guidance -->
      <h2>Practical Guidance: Just Start</h2>

      <p>
        The most important advice in this entire module is this: <strong>pick one and start using it</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The differences between these models matter at the margins. For the vast majority of tasks
        most clinicians will encounter, all three will produce useful results. The limiting factor
        isn't which model you choose—it's whether you've developed the skill to use it effectively.
      </p>

      <h3>Week 1: Establish a Baseline</h3>
      <p>
        Choose whichever model you have easiest access to. For your first week, use it for
        low-stakes tasks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Summarizing an article you're reading anyway</li>
        <li>Drafting an email you'll heavily edit</li>
        <li>Explaining a concept to yourself before explaining it to a patient</li>
        <li>Brainstorming questions for a meeting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don't worry about optimization. Just get comfortable with the interaction pattern.</p>

      <h3>Week 2: Apply Prompting Principles</h3>
      <p>Revisit the prompting framework from Module 3 and apply it deliberately:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give the model a role ("You are helping me prepare for a difficult conversation with a parent")</li>
        <li>Provide context ("The patient is 8 years old with a new ADHD diagnosis")</li>
        <li>Be specific about format ("I need three main points, in language a non-medical parent would understand")</li>
        <li>Include constraints ("Avoid medical jargon; emphasize that this is manageable")</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Notice how the quality of outputs changes as you prompt more skillfully.</p>

      <h3>Week 3: Try Something Harder</h3>
      <p>Push into a task that actually matters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Draft a real (de-identified) clinical note</li>
        <li>Summarize a complex patient case for a referral</li>
        <li>Create patient education materials for a condition you see frequently</li>
        <li>Analyze a clinical guideline and identify key practice implications</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Evaluate the output critically. What did it get right? Where did it need correction?
        What would you prompt differently next time?
      </p>

      <h3>Week 4: Compare</h3>
      <p>
        Now try a second model with a task you've done before. Use the same prompt and compare
        outputs. You'll develop intuition for the differences—and often find that your preference
        is less about the model and more about how you've learned to work with it.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <!-- The Cost Question -->
      <h2>The Cost Question</h2>

      <p>Let's be direct about money.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Free tiers are sufficient for exploration and light use.</strong> If you're using
        AI occasionally—a few times a week for non-critical tasks—you may never need to pay.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>$20/month is the standard paid tier.</strong> ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, and
        Google AI Pro all cluster around this price point. At this tier, you get higher usage limits,
        access to the best models, and priority features. For a professional tool you might use daily,
        $20/month is modest—less than many software subscriptions with narrower utility. This is
        where most regular users land.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Premium tiers ($200-250/month) are for power users.</strong> If you're running into
        limits on the $20 tier, pushing complex coding projects, or need maximum model capabilities
        for professional work, the premium tiers exist. But most users won't need them.
      </p>

      <div class="callout callout-principle">
        <div class="callout-title">Recommendation for Most Clinicians</div>
        <ol class="mb-0">
          <li>Start with free tiers</li>
          <li>Upgrade to ~$20/month when you hit limits regularly</li>
          <li>Evaluate premium tiers only if you're a genuine power user</li>
          <li>Discuss organizational deployment with compliance and IT before rolling out team solutions</li>

      <!-- Benchmarks Section -->
      <h2>Understanding AI Benchmarks</h2>

      <p>
        You'll often see AI companies touting benchmark scores when announcing new models.
        Headlines declare one model "beats" another on some test. But what do these numbers
        actually mean—and more importantly, what <em>don't</em> they mean?
      </p>

      <h3>What Benchmarks Measure</h3>
      <p>
        Benchmarks are standardized tests designed to evaluate specific AI capabilities.
        They provide a common yardstick for comparing models on tasks like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Knowledge recall:</strong> Can the model answer questions across academic domains?</li>
        <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Can it work through multi-step logic problems?</li>
        <li><strong>Coding:</strong> Can it write functional code that solves programming challenges?</li>
        <li><strong>Domain expertise:</strong> How does it perform on professional exams (medical, legal, etc.)?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What Benchmarks Don't Measure</h3>
      <p>
        Here's what no benchmark captures—and what often matters most for real-world use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Writing quality:</strong> Does the output sound natural and require minimal editing?</li>
        <li><strong>Appropriate uncertainty:</strong> Does the model say "I don't know" when it should?</li>
        <li><strong>Instruction following:</strong> Does it do what you actually asked, or what it thinks you asked?</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Does it give similar quality outputs across multiple attempts?</li>
        <li><strong>Your specific use case:</strong> A model that aces coding benchmarks might produce worse clinical notes than one that scores lower.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">The Gap Between Benchmarks and Reality</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          A model scoring 90% vs 88% on a knowledge test is not meaningfully different for
          most practical purposes. What matters is whether the model helps <em>you</em> do
          <em>your</em> work better. The only benchmark that truly matters is your own
          experience using the tool.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>How to Use Benchmark Data</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>As a rough filter:</strong> If a model scores dramatically lower on everything, it's probably less capable overall.</li>
        <li><strong>For specific tasks:</strong> If you primarily need coding help, look at coding benchmarks. For medical questions, look at MedQA scores.</li>
        <li><strong>With skepticism:</strong> Companies often cherry-pick favorable benchmarks. Independent testing (like LMArena) provides more balanced pictures.</li>
        <li><strong>As a starting point:</strong> Use benchmarks to decide which 2-3 models to try, then let your own experience guide your choice.</li>
      </ol>

          and factual accuracy (SimpleQA). Claude Opus 4.5 dominates real-world coding tasks (SWE-Bench).
          GPT-5.1 excels on medical knowledge (MedQA) and offers the most mature ecosystem. But here's

      <!-- Summary -->
      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>
        ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are all capable foundation models that can meaningfully assist
        clinical work. ChatGPT offers the broadest ecosystem and most mature feature set. Claude
        provides nuanced reasoning and a safety-first approach. Gemini integrates deeply with
        Google Workspace and offers the easiest HIPAA pathway for organizations already in that ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        The choice between them matters less than developing skill with whichever you choose.
        These are tools that respond to how you use them. A well-crafted prompt to any of these
        models will outperform a vague prompt to the "best" model.

          Think of them as brilliant but inexperienced colleagues: genuinely helpful, occasionally
          wrong, always requiring supervision. With that framing and the prompting skills from
          earlier modules, you're ready to begin. Now close this document and go have a conversation
          with one of them. That's where the real learning happens.

            <strong>Why not Grok?</strong> You may wonder why xAI's Grok isn't included here.
            While Grok has some capable underlying technology, we don't recommend it for clinical
            use due to significant concerns about accuracy and safety guardrails.
            <p>
              In early 2025, Grok generated and spread false information about prominent public
              figures, including fabricated claims about an NBA owner that were widely amplified
              on X (formerly Twitter). The system was also found to produce misleading election-related
              content and struggled with basic factual queries where other models performed reliably.
              Independent evaluations have noted that Grok's safety measures are notably weaker than
              those of ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini—the model is more likely to generate harmful content
              when prompted.
            </p>
            <p>
              For clinical applications where accuracy and appropriate guardrails matter, these
              issues are disqualifying. The three platforms covered in this module have demonstrated
              more robust approaches to safety and factual accuracy—though as we discuss throughout,
              all AI outputs require verification.
