        <div class="callout-title">Core Question</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          How can AI-generated images and videos enhance patient education,
          practice communication, and medical teaching—while avoiding the
          pitfalls unique to visual content?
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h2>Introduction: Why Visual AI Matters in Healthcare</h2>

      <p>
        In our previous modules, we explored how large language models process text, the
        importance of effective prompting, and how clinical decision support tools augment
        your practice. Now we turn to something that might feel more surprising: the ability
        to create images and videos from simple text descriptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        You might reasonably ask, "Why would a physician need to generate images?" The answer
        spans more territory than you might expect:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Patient education materials explaining conditions and procedures</li>
        <li>Practice marketing assets—logos, social media graphics, presentation visuals</li>
        <li>Educational content for learners</li>
        <li>Conceptual illustrations for research presentations</li>
        <li>Visual aids during patient conversations</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The technology has matured remarkably over the past year. What once produced uncanny,
        obviously artificial images now generates visuals that can be genuinely useful—sometimes
        indistinguishable from professional photography or illustration. And video generation,
        which seemed like science fiction just two years ago, now produces clips that can convey
        motion, demonstrate concepts, and tell visual stories.
      </p>

      <p>
        This module covers the leading tools available today, how to use them effectively,
        and—critically—the limitations and ethical considerations that should guide your use.
        We'll focus on practical applications relevant to clinical practice and medical education,
        with hands-on prompt examples you can try immediately.
      </p>

        <p>
          If you want to start creating AI images and videos today, <strong>Google Gemini</strong>
          with <strong>Nano Banana</strong> is your best starting point. It's free, generates the
          most accurate text in images (critical for patient education), and now powers video
          generation through <strong>Veo 3.1</strong>. Open <a href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">gemini.google.com</a>
          and try: <em>"Create a simple diagram showing how an inhaler delivers medication to the
          lungs, patient education style, with labels pointing to key structures."</em>
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          For finished materials (flyers, social posts, handouts), pair Gemini with
          <strong><a href="https://canva.com" target="_blank">Canva</a></strong>—Canva now integrates
          Nano Banana Pro directly, so you can generate and design in one place.

      <!-- Building on What We've Learned -->
      <h2>Building on What We've Learned</h2>

      <p>
        Before diving into visual AI, let's connect this to the concepts we've established
        throughout this course.
      </p>

      <h3>The Prompting Principles Still Apply</h3>

      <p>
        Remember our analogy between AI prompting and taking a patient history? The same
        principles transfer directly to visual generation. A vague prompt yields vague results.
        Specificity and context matter enormously.
      </p>

      <p>Consider the parallel:</p>

      <div class="prompt-examples">
        <div class="prompt-example bad">
          <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="x-circle"></i> Poor History</div>
          <p>"The patient has chest pain."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="prompt-example bad">
          <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="x-circle"></i> Poor Image Prompt</div>
          <p>"Make a picture of a heart."</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="prompt-examples">
        <div class="prompt-example good">
          <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="check-circle"></i> Rich History</div>
          <p>"67-year-old male with sudden-onset substernal chest pressure radiating to left arm, associated diaphoresis, onset 2 hours ago while at rest, history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, currently on lisinopril and atorvastatin."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="prompt-example good">
          <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="check-circle"></i> Rich Image Prompt</div>
          <p>"A detailed anatomical cross-section illustration of a human heart showing the coronary arteries, educational medical illustration style, clean white background, labeled structures, suitable for patient education materials, professional medical textbook quality."</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The specificity you bring to a prompt directly shapes the quality and usefulness of the output.</p>

      <h3>Models Are Not Artists—They're Pattern Synthesizers</h3>

      <p>
        Just as language models don't "understand" in the human sense, image generators don't
        "see" or "imagine." They've learned statistical patterns from vast image-text datasets.
        When you describe something, the model generates pixels that match the patterns associated
        with your description.
      </p>

      <p>
        This has practical implications. The models excel at generating images that resemble
        their training data. They struggle with novel combinations, unusual perspectives, or
        highly specific technical accuracy. A request for a "cross-section of the brachial plexus"
        will produce something anatomically plausible but potentially inaccurate in details—much
        like how a language model might generate confident-sounding but subtly wrong medical
        information.
      </p>

      <h3>Verification Remains Essential</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Critical Reminder</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          We've emphasized throughout this course that AI outputs require human verification.
          This applies <strong>doubly</strong> to visual content, especially anything medical
          or scientific. An AI-generated anatomical diagram might look convincing while containing
          errors that could mislead patients or learners. Always review generated visuals with
          your clinical knowledge, and never use AI-generated medical images as authoritative
          references for clinical decisions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Prompting Strategies -->
      <h2>Prompting Strategies for Visual AI</h2>

      <p>
        Drawing on our prompting module, here are specific strategies optimized for image
        and video generation.
      </p>

      <h3>The Anatomy of an Effective Image Prompt</h3>

      <p>Effective prompts typically include several elements:</p>

      <div class="key-points-grid">
        <div class="key-point-card">
          <h4>1. Subject</h4>
          <p>What is the main focus? Be specific about who or what appears.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="key-point-card">
          <h4>2. Action/State</h4>
          <p>What is happening? Is the subject doing something or in a particular state?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="key-point-card">
          <h4>3. Setting/Context</h4>
          <p>Where is this taking place? What's the environment?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="key-point-card">
          <h4>4. Style</h4>
          <p>What aesthetic are you going for? Photorealistic, illustration, diagram, infographic?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="key-point-card">
          <h4>5. Technical Specs</h4>
          <p>Aspect ratio, resolution, color palette, lighting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="key-point-card">
          <h4>6. Purpose Qualifier</h4>
          <p>What will this be used for? "Suitable for patient education," "social media post format."</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Style Keywords That Work</h3>

      <p>Certain keywords reliably influence output style:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>"Medical illustration style"</strong> or <strong>"medical textbook quality"</strong> — Clean, educational aesthetic</li>
        <li><strong>"Photorealistic"</strong> — Aims for photography-like output</li>
        <li><strong>"Infographic style"</strong> — Data visualization, clean graphics</li>
        <li><strong>"Vector illustration"</strong> — Clean lines, scalable, logo-appropriate</li>
        <li><strong>"Warm and friendly"</strong> — Patient-facing, approachable</li>
        <li><strong>"Professional"</strong> or <strong>"clinical"</strong> — Appropriate for healthcare context</li>
        <li><strong>"Clean white background"</strong> — Useful for materials you'll composite later</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Iteration and Refinement</h3>

      <p>Rarely will your first generation be exactly what you need. Build in time for iteration:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Start broad, then narrow:</strong> Your first prompt establishes the general direction. Subsequent prompts refine.</li>
        <li><strong>Identify what's working:</strong> When you get a result, note which elements you like before requesting changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Be specific about changes:</strong> "Make the background lighter" is better than "I don't like the background."</li>
        <li><strong>Use built-in editing:</strong> Most tools now allow selective editing—often faster than regenerating entirely.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Video-Specific Prompting</h3>

      <p>Video prompts need additional considerations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Describe motion explicitly:</strong> "Camera slowly pans left," "subject walks toward camera," "gentle zoom in."</li>
        <li><strong>Specify pacing:</strong> "Slow, contemplative motion" vs. "quick, dynamic movement."</li>
        <li><strong>Consider audio:</strong> If using Veo or Sora with audio, describe the soundscape: "ambient office sounds," "no dialogue, just environmental audio."</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Current video AI handles single continuous actions better than complex multi-step sequences.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr>

      <!-- Limitations and Critical Considerations -->
      <h2>Limitations and Critical Considerations</h2>

      <h3>What These Tools Cannot Reliably Do</h3>

      <p>Being clear about limitations helps you use these tools appropriately:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Anatomical accuracy:</strong> AI-generated anatomical images may contain errors. Never use them as clinical references or for diagnostic education without expert review.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistent characters:</strong> Maintaining the exact same person across multiple images remains challenging. Reference image features help but don't guarantee consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex text:</strong> While newer models have improved dramatically, long passages of text still risk errors. Always verify any text in generated images.</li>
        <li><strong>Specific real people:</strong> Most tools restrict generation of identifiable real individuals. This is a safety feature, not a bug.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex hands and poses:</strong> Though improved, hands remain a weak point. Check carefully when hands are prominent.</li>
        <li><strong>Video complexity:</strong> Video AI currently handles simple scenes well but struggles with complex multi-person interactions or rapid action sequences.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-principle">
        <div class="callout-title">Representation and Bias</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          AI models reflect biases in their training data. When generating images of people,
          be intentional about diversity and representation. Don't default to narrow demographics
          in your prompts.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Transparency about AI origin:</strong> Patients and colleagues should know when images are AI-generated, particularly for educational or clinical materials. All major tools now add invisible watermarks, but visible disclosure is also appropriate.</p>

      <p><strong>Copyright and commercial use:</strong> AI-generated images raise unresolved copyright questions. Most tools grant commercial use rights for images you generate through their platforms. However, the underlying legal framework remains unsettled—multiple lawsuits are ongoing. For high-stakes commercial use, consider consulting with legal counsel.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Patient Privacy Reminder</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          <strong>Never upload patient photos or identifiable information to AI image tools.</strong>
          These platforms are not HIPAA-compliant for patient data processing. Never upload
          patient-identifiable information—photos, names, medical record numbers, or any
          combination of information that could identify a patient—to consumer AI tools.
          If you need to describe a clinical scenario for educational content, use fictional
          composite cases, not real patients.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Deepfakes and misuse:</strong> These same tools that create useful content can generate misinformation. As a healthcare professional, you have particular credibility—be thoughtful about how AI-generated content from your practice could be misused if shared out of context.</p>

        <li>Have a colleague review for clarity and accuracy</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Advanced: Short Educational Video</h3>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create a 15-30 second educational video demonstrating a patient self-care technique.</p>

      <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Veo or Sora</p>

      <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose a simple technique (e.g., nasal saline irrigation, proper splint application, wound care)</li>
        <li>Break the technique into 3-4 distinct steps</li>
        <li>Generate a short clip for each step</li>
        <li>Use a video editor (or Canva) to combine clips and add text overlays</li>
        <li>Review for accuracy—AI may generate incorrect technique</li>
      </ol>

        <p class="mb-0">
          Visual AI represents another dimension of how artificial intelligence can augment
          healthcare practice. Like the language models we've discussed throughout this course,
          these tools work best when humans bring clinical judgment, creativity, and ethical
          awareness to the collaboration. The images and videos these tools generate are starting
          points—raw material that you refine, verify, and deploy in service of better patient
          care and communication.
