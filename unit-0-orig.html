          How can I use AI to make learning materials work for me—before I understand how AI works?
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <p>
        Most courses on clinical AI start with definitions: machine learning, neural networks,
        training data. There's a place for that—and we'll get there in Module 1. But if you're
        a busy clinician, you probably want to know: <strong>what can I actually do with this,
        right now?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This module inverts the usual sequence. Instead of learning theory first and applying it
        later, you'll start by using an AI tool to solve a real problem you already have:
        keeping up with medical literature. Along the way, you'll develop intuitions about
        how these systems behave—intuitions that will make the theory easier to absorb.
      </p>

      <!-- Tool Introduction -->
      <div class="callout callout-tool">
        <div class="callout-title">Tool: NotebookLM</div>
        <p>
          <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com" target="_blank">NotebookLM</a> is a
          document-grounded AI assistant from Google. You upload your own sources—PDFs,
          articles, guidelines—and it answers questions based only on that material.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          <strong>Why start here:</strong> Unlike general-purpose chatbots, NotebookLM is
          constrained to your uploaded content. This makes it safer for clinical learning:
          it can't invent facts from the open internet, only synthesize what you've given it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Two High-Yield Use Cases</h2>

      <p>
        Before we complicate things with five examples and edge cases, let's nail two
        workflows that will immediately save you time.
      </p>

      <!-- Example 1 -->
      <div class="example-card">
        <div class="example-header">
          <span class="example-number">1</span>
          <h3 class="example-title">Guideline → Decision Aid</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Clinical guidelines are essential but dense. The AAP bronchiolitis guideline,
          for instance, runs dozens of pages. What you need at 2 AM is a one-page summary
          organized by decision points.
        </p>
        <div class="prompt-label">Sample Prompt</div>
        <div class="prompt-box">Summarize this guideline as a one-page clinical decision aid.
Organize by key decision points (when to admit, when to
discharge, when to use supplemental O2). Flag anything
that changed from the previous version.</div>
        <div class="outcome-box">
          <strong>What you get:</strong> A structured summary that maps to your actual
          workflow, with change flags that highlight what's new. Trade-off: you'll still
          need to verify critical thresholds against the source.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Example 2 -->
      <div class="example-card">
        <div class="example-header">
          <span class="example-number">2</span>
          <h3 class="example-title">Papers → Audio Overview</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          NotebookLM's "Audio Overview" feature generates a podcast-style conversation
          between two AI hosts discussing your uploaded sources. It's remarkably good
          for commute-time learning.
        </p>
        <div class="prompt-label">How to Use</div>
        <div class="prompt-box">1. Upload 2-3 related papers (e.g., recent GLP-1
   agonist trials, or AI sepsis alert studies)
2. Click "Generate Audio Overview"
3. Listen during commute, workout, or dishes</div>
        <div class="outcome-box">
          <strong>What you get:</strong> A ~10-15 minute audio summary that captures
          main findings and puts them in conversation. Trade-off: the hosts will
          occasionally oversimplify or miss nuance—treat it as a first pass, not a
          final read.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Underlying Principle -->
      <div class="callout callout-principle">
        <div class="callout-title">The Underlying Principle</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          AI literacy for clinicians is not about understanding how the models work.
          It's about learning to <strong>direct them toward useful ends</strong> while
          <strong>recognizing their limits</strong>. You are the supervisor. The AI is
          the tool.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Warning -->
      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Critical Limitation</div>
        <p>
          NotebookLM will hallucinate. It will miss nuance. It will confidently summarize
          things it doesn't fully understand.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Every output requires your verification. But starting with a tool where you
          control the sources—rather than asking ChatGPT to diagnose patients—is a
          safer sandbox for building intuition.

      <!-- What's Next -->
      <h2>What's Next</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you've seen what AI can do in a constrained, document-grounded setting,
        Module 1 will give you the conceptual vocabulary to understand <em>why</em> it
        works—and why it sometimes doesn't. We'll introduce the AI Triad (Data, Algorithms,
        Compute) and map it to infrastructure you already know: EHRs, imaging systems,
        clinical decision support.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal isn't to make you a machine learning engineer. It's to give you the
        mental models to be a sophisticated consumer and supervisor of these systems.
