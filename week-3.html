        <div class="callout-title">Core Question</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          How do healthcare algorithms systematically disadvantage certain patient 
          populations—even when designers have no discriminatory intent?
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In 2019, Obermeyer and colleagues published a landmark paper in <em>Science</em> 
        demonstrating that a widely-used algorithm for identifying high-risk patients 
        systematically underestimated the health needs of Black patients. The algorithm 
        wasn't designed to discriminate—it simply used healthcare costs as a proxy for 
        health needs. But because Black patients historically face barriers to accessing 
        care, their costs were lower even at equivalent illness severity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This case illustrates a crucial principle: <strong>algorithms inherit the biases 
        embedded in their training data</strong>. Bias isn't (usually) a bug in the code; 
        it's a feature of the data the code learned from.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

      <h3>Proxy Variables and Hidden Discrimination</h3>
      <p>
        A proxy variable is something you measure as a stand-in for something you 
        can't directly measure. Using healthcare costs as a proxy for health needs 
        seems reasonable—sicker people should cost more. But when access to care 
        varies systematically across groups, the proxy encodes discrimination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other dangerous proxies: ZIP code (encodes race, income), insurance type 
        (encodes employment status), medication adherence (encodes access to pharmacy, 
        transportation).
      </p>

      <h3>Label Bias vs. Feature Bias</h3>
      <p>
        Bias can enter algorithms through the outcome you're predicting (label bias) 
        or the inputs you use (feature bias). Obermeyer's case was label bias—the 
        wrong outcome was being predicted. But feature bias is equally pernicious: 
        if Black patients' symptoms are documented differently, or if imaging equipment 
        performs differently on darker skin, the inputs themselves are biased.
      </p>

      <h3>Fairness Definitions and Trade-offs</h3>
      <p>
        There are multiple mathematical definitions of algorithmic fairness, and they 
        can't all be satisfied simultaneously. Equal accuracy across groups? Equal 
        positive predictive value? Equal false negative rates? Choosing a fairness 
        criterion is a values decision, not a technical one.
      </p>

        <p class="mb-0">
          Imagine designing a kidney transplant allocation algorithm. As you consider
          which variables to include—ZIP code, insurance type, medication adherence
          history—notice how each seemingly neutral choice can encode socioeconomic
          and racial disparities.

        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Should algorithms ever include race as an input variable? What are 
            arguments for and against?
          </li>
          <li>
            How would you audit an algorithm you're already using in your institution 
            for potential bias? What data would you need?
          </li>
          <li>
            Obermeyer's team worked with the algorithm vendor to reduce bias by 80%. 
            What does the collaborative fix—rather than removal—suggest about how 
            we should respond to biased algorithms?
