          <strong>Start. Today.</strong> Don't wait until you feel ready. Don't wait until you've
          read one more article or taken one more course. The best way to learn AI is to use AI.
          Build something small. Break it. Fix it. Build something else. The people who will thrive
          in an AI-augmented world are the ones who started before they felt qualified.

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h2>Congratulations—Now the Real Work Begins</h2>

      <p>
        If you've made it through this curriculum, you now understand more about AI in healthcare
        than most of your colleagues. You know how language models think (and fail to think). You
        understand the privacy landscape. You can evaluate clinical AI tools critically. You've
        seen the promise and pitfalls of AI-powered documentation and decision support.
      </p>

      <p>
        But here's the uncomfortable truth: <strong>everything you just learned has a half-life.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The field is moving at a pace that makes even experts feel like perpetual beginners. GPT-4
        was released in March 2023. By the time you read this, we'll be multiple generations beyond
        it—and whatever comes next will probably surprise us. The specific tools, the specific
        capabilities, the specific limitations—all of these are shifting under our feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        So what's the point of learning any of this if it's going to change?
      </p>

      <p>
        Because <strong>the fundamentals transfer</strong>. Critical evaluation skills don't expire.
        Understanding how to supervise AI outputs works across generations. Knowing how to think
        about privacy, bias, and clinical integration—these are durable skills even as the
        technology evolves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your job now isn't to "finish" learning about AI. It's to <strong>build habits for
        continuous learning</strong> so you can evolve alongside the technology.
      </p>

      <!-- The Landscape is Fast -->
      <h2>Accept the Speed (Or Get Left Behind)</h2>

      <p>
        Let's be honest about what you're up against. In 2024 alone:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>OpenAI released GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, o1-preview, and o1 (the reasoning model)</li>
        <li>Anthropic shipped Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, then 3.5 Sonnet, then Claude 3.5 Sonnet (yes, twice)</li>
        <li>Google released Gemini 1.5 Pro, Flash, and announced Gemini 2.0</li>
        <li>Meta open-sourced Llama 3 and 3.1, fundamentally changing the open-source landscape</li>
        <li>Apple shipped Apple Intelligence across their ecosystem</li>
        <li>Microsoft embedded Copilot into everything</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        And that's just the major releases from major players. The startup ecosystem, the research
        labs, the open-source community—all moving at similar velocity.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can't keep up with everything. <strong>No one can.</strong> The goal isn't comprehensive
        knowledge—it's developing an efficient information diet and learning how to quickly evaluate
        what matters for your work.
      </p>

      <h3>Build Your Information Diet</h3>

      <p>
        You need reliable sources that filter the noise without missing the signal. Here's a

        fine. You're looking for the occasional piece that changes how you think or points to
        something you should try.

      <!-- Find Your Niche -->
      <h2>Find Your Niche</h2>

      <p>
        Here's the liberating secret: <strong>you don't need to be an AI generalist.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The person who becomes known as "the one who figured out how to use AI for [specific clinical
        workflow]" will be more valuable than someone with broad but shallow AI knowledge. Depth
        beats breadth, especially in a field this complex.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think about what frustrates you most in your daily work:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Is it documentation? Go deep on ambient AI and learn how to optimize it for your specialty.</li>
        <li>Is it patient communication? Build custom GPTs that handle your most common questions.</li>
        <li>Is it keeping up with literature? Master NotebookLM and AI-powered research workflows.</li>
        <li>Is it practice management? Explore how AI can handle scheduling, referrals, prior auth.</li>
        <li>Is it education? Look at how AI can enhance teaching, build simulations, create learning materials.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Pick <strong>one area</strong>. Spend 90% of your AI learning time there. Become the
        expert in that niche. Then expand.
      </p>

      <div class="callout callout-principle">
        <div class="callout-title">The Specialist Advantage</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          A pediatric hospitalist who deeply understands AI documentation will contribute more to
          their field than an administrator who superficially understands all AI applications. Your
          clinical expertise is the differentiator—combine it with focused AI knowledge and you
          become genuinely valuable.

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Evals deserve special attention. As AI gets deployed in higher-stakes settings, the ability
        to rigorously test what it can and can't do becomes critical. This isn't just for researchers—
        clinicians who understand evaluation methodology can ask better questions of vendors and
        make better deployment decisions.
      </p>

      <!-- Developer Tools -->
      <h2>If You Want to Build: Developer Foundations</h2>

      <p>
        Vibe coding is real and powerful—but the most capable builders understand at least the
        basics of what's happening under the hood. You don't need to become a software engineer,
        but some foundational skills will multiply your effectiveness.
      </p>

      <h3>Git: Your Safety Net</h3>

      <p>
        Git is version control—it lets you save snapshots of your work and roll back when things
        break. Every serious software project uses it. Even if you're vibe coding, understanding
        Git means:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>You can save working versions before experimenting</li>
        <li>You can undo catastrophic AI-generated changes</li>
        <li>You can collaborate with others (or with AI agents) without losing work</li>
        <li>You can deploy your projects to the web</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        GitHub (the most popular Git hosting service) also gives you free website hosting, issue
        tracking, and collaboration tools. Learning the basics takes an afternoon and pays dividends
        forever.
      </p>

      <h3>The Command Line: Where Power Lives</h3>

      <p>
        The command line (terminal, shell, CLI—same thing) feels intimidating but is simpler than
        you think. It's just typing commands instead of clicking buttons. Why bother?
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Most serious AI tools work best from the command line</li>
        <li>Automation becomes possible (run tasks on schedule, process multiple files)</li>
        <li>You can use AI coding assistants that work in terminal environments</li>
        <li>Many problems are solved with a single command that would take dozens of clicks</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Start by opening Terminal (Mac) or PowerShell (Windows) and learning five commands: cd, ls,
        mkdir, rm, and cp. That's enough to navigate. Build from there.
      </p>

      <!-- Agents -->
      <h2>The Next Frontier: AI Agents</h2>

      <p>
        Everything we've discussed so far involves AI that responds to your prompts. The next wave
        is <strong>AI that takes action autonomously</strong>—agents that can browse the web,
        execute code, call APIs, and complete multi-step tasks without constant supervision.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where things get both exciting and concerning:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exciting:</strong> Imagine an AI that monitors your patient panel, alerts you to concerning trends, drafts messages to patients who need outreach, and schedules follow-ups—all while you sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Concerning:</strong> Imagine an AI that makes decisions with patient-safety implications while you're not watching.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The governance frameworks we discussed earlier become even more critical as AI moves from
        "tool I use" to "system that acts on my behalf."
      </p>

      <div class="reading-list">
        <div class="reading-item">

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        We're not going deep on agents here—they deserve their own module. But know that this is
        coming, and the foundational knowledge you've built (especially around supervision,
        evaluation, and governance) will be essential.
      </p>

      <!-- What's Coming -->
      <h2>What's Coming: AI 202</h2>

      <p>
        This curriculum was designed as a foundation—<strong>AI 101</strong>. There's more to come.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>AI 202</strong> is in development. It will go deeper on:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Agents in Clinical Practice:</strong> Building, deploying, and governing autonomous systems</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Evaluation:</strong> How to rigorously test AI systems before deployment</li>

        <p>
          The clinicians who will matter most in the next decade aren't necessarily the ones with
          the most AI knowledge. They're the ones who learned to think clearly about what AI should
          and shouldn't do, who maintained their clinical judgment while leveraging AI capabilities,
          and who helped their patients navigate an increasingly AI-augmented healthcare system.
        </p>

          You've started that journey. Keep going.
