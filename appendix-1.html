        <div class="callout-title">Core Question</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          As healthcare increasingly adopts AI, what are the environmental
          implications—and how should clinicians and institutions factor
          sustainability into AI deployment decisions?
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        AI systems require substantial computational resources, which translates to
        significant energy consumption. For clinicians evaluating AI tools,
        understanding these environmental costs is part of responsible technology
        adoption—particularly as healthcare organizations increasingly prioritize
        sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        This appendix provides context on AI's environmental footprint without
        advocating for or against AI adoption. The goal is informed decision-making.
      </p>

      <h2>The Scale of AI Energy Use</h2>

      <h3>Training vs. Inference</h3>
      <p>
        AI energy costs come in two forms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Training:</strong> The one-time (or periodic) process of building
        the model. Training large language models like GPT-4 requires massive
        computational resources—estimates suggest training runs can consume energy
        equivalent to hundreds of homes' annual usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Inference:</strong> The ongoing cost of running the model to
        generate outputs. Each query to ChatGPT, each image analyzed by a diagnostic
        AI, consumes energy. At scale, inference often exceeds training costs.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout callout-principle">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Insight</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          A single ChatGPT query uses roughly 10x the energy of a Google search.
          When millions of users make dozens of queries daily, these differences
          compound significantly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Data Center Impact</h3>
      <p>
        AI workloads are driving rapid expansion of data centers, which require:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Electricity:</strong> For computation and cooling systems</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Many data centers use evaporative cooling,
        consuming millions of gallons annually</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> GPUs and specialized AI chips have their own
        manufacturing footprint</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Major tech companies have seen their carbon emissions rise despite
        renewable energy commitments, largely due to AI infrastructure expansion.
      </p>

      <h2>Healthcare-Specific Considerations</h2>

      <h3>Imaging AI</h3>
      <p>
        Radiology and pathology AI systems process large image files, which is
        computationally intensive. A hospital running AI analysis on every chest
        X-ray or CT scan generates continuous inference costs. The benefit
        (faster diagnosis, reduced workload) must be weighed against resource use.
      </p>

      <h3>Ambient Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        AI scribes that transcribe and summarize clinical encounters require
        continuous speech-to-text processing plus LLM summarization. For a health
        system with thousands of daily encounters, this represents substantial
        ongoing computation.
      </p>

      <h3>Clinical Decision Support</h3>
      <p>
        Real-time CDS tools that query AI models for every patient interaction
        (alerts, suggestions, risk scores) generate high inference volumes.
        The clinical value per query varies—some alerts are ignored, others
        change care.
      </p>

      <h2>Frameworks for Thinking About This</h2>

      <h3>Net Benefit Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Consider AI's environmental cost in context:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does the AI reduce other resource use? (e.g., fewer unnecessary tests,
        shorter hospital stays, reduced travel for telehealth)</li>
        <li>What's the alternative's footprint? (e.g., flying pathology slides
        across the country vs. digital analysis)</li>
        <li>Does improved diagnosis prevent downstream resource-intensive care?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Proportionality</h3>
      <p>
        Not all AI use cases are equal:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High value:</strong> AI that catches cancers, prevents sepsis
        deaths, or enables care access may justify significant resource use</li>
        <li><strong>Lower value:</strong> AI for convenience features with
        marginal clinical benefit deserves more scrutiny</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Institutional Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        Individual clinicians have limited control over infrastructure choices.
        But institutions can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select vendors with strong sustainability practices</li>
        <li>Choose cloud providers powered by renewable energy</li>
        <li>Right-size AI deployments (not everything needs the largest model)</li>
        <li>Consider on-premise vs. cloud trade-offs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Clinicians Can Do</h2>

      <h3>Ask Questions</h3>
      <p>
        When evaluating AI tools, consider asking vendors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where does computation happen? What's the data center's energy source?</li>
        <li>Is this the right-sized model for the task, or is it using a
        general-purpose LLM when a smaller specialized model would suffice?</li>
        <li>What's the per-query resource footprint?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Use Thoughtfully</h3>
      <p>
        This isn't about avoiding AI—it's about intentional use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use AI when it adds clinical value, not just because it's available</li>
        <li>Consider whether the task requires the most powerful model or if
        simpler tools suffice</li>
        <li>Batch queries when possible rather than multiple small requests</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Advocate Institutionally</h3>
      <p>
        Push for sustainability to be part of AI procurement criteria. Health
        systems increasingly have sustainability officers and carbon reduction
        commitments—AI infrastructure should be part of those conversations.
      </p>

      <h2>Perspective</h2>
      <p>
        Healthcare itself has a substantial environmental footprint—estimated at
        8-10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. AI is one factor among many,
        including building operations, supply chains, and pharmaceutical
        manufacturing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question isn't whether AI has environmental costs (it does) but
        whether its benefits justify those costs and whether we're deploying it
        thoughtfully. The same critical thinking you apply to clinical AI
        effectiveness should extend to its broader impacts.
      </p>

      <div class="callout callout-principle">
        <div class="callout-title">Bottom Line</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          AI's environmental footprint is real and growing. As clinicians,
          you're not responsible for solving this at the infrastructure level,
          but being informed allows you to advocate for responsible deployment
          and make thoughtful choices about the tools you use.
