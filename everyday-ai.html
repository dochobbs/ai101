        <p class="mb-0">
          How can AI tools transform your everyday professional and personal tasks—from
          analyzing business data to helping your kids with homework—while you build the
          skills to customize these tools for exactly what you need?
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h2>Introduction: AI as Your Daily Companion</h2>

      <p>
        We've covered AI in clinical contexts—decision support, ambient scribes, image
        generation for patient education. But the same tools that help you practice medicine
        can transform how you handle everything else: the business side of your practice,
        your continuing education, your personal projects, even helping your kids learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        This module explores the everyday applications of AI that you might not have
        considered. More importantly, it introduces you to building <em>custom AI tools</em>
        that work exactly the way you want them to—no coding required.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think of this module as expanding your toolkit. You've learned to use AI for
        clinical questions. Now let's apply those same skills to everything else.
      </p>

      <!-- Business and Professional Uses -->
      <h2>Business and Professional Applications</h2>

      <h3>Business Analysis: Finding Patterns in Data</h3>

      <p>
        Whether you're analyzing your practice's patient volume trends, reviewing quarterly
        financials, or evaluating a potential investment, AI excels at pattern recognition
        in business data.
      </p>

      <div class="example-card">
        <div class="example-header">
          <span class="example-number"><i data-lucide="trending-up"></i></span>
          <h4 class="example-title">Example Use Cases</h4>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Upload your practice's monthly revenue data and ask for trend analysis</li>
          <li>Compare this quarter's metrics to the same period last year</li>
          <li>Identify which services are growing vs. declining</li>
          <li>Analyze payer mix and reimbursement patterns</li>
          <li>Forecast staffing needs based on historical volume</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="prompt-examples">
        <div class="prompt-example good">
          <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="sparkles"></i> Sample Prompt</div>
          <p>"I'm uploading 24 months of our practice's visit data. Please analyze: (1) overall volume trends, (2) seasonal patterns, (3) which visit types are growing fastest, and (4) any concerning declines I should investigate. Present findings with specific numbers and percentages."</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Contract Review: Spotting What Matters</h3>

      <p>
        Contracts are dense, boring, and full of language designed to protect the other
        party. AI can help you identify the provisions that actually matter—though you
        should always have important contracts reviewed by an attorney.
      </p>

      <div class="example-card">
        <div class="example-header">
          <span class="example-number"><i data-lucide="file-text"></i></span>

        </div>
        <ol>
          <li>Upload the contract (redact sensitive information if needed)</li>
          <li>Ask for a plain-language summary of key terms</li>
          <li>Request identification of unusual or potentially problematic clauses</li>
          <li>Compare terms against industry standards</li>
          <li>Generate a list of questions to ask before signing</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="prompt-examples">
        <div class="prompt-example good">
          <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="sparkles"></i> Sample Prompt</div>
          <p>"This is a vendor agreement for our new EHR system.

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Important Limitation</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          AI can help you understand contracts, but it cannot provide legal advice. For
          employment agreements, partnership contracts, real estate transactions, or
          anything with significant financial implications, always consult a qualified attorney.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Spreadsheet Creation: From Idea to Working Model</h3>

      <p>
        Need a budget tracker? A patient callback log? A scheduling template? AI can
        build spreadsheets from scratch based on your description, complete with formulas.
      </p>

      <div class="example-card">
        <div class="example-header">
          <span class="example-number"><i data-lucide="table"></i></span>
          <h4 class="example-title">What AI Can Build</h4>

          <li>CME credit trackers with expiration alerts</li>
          <li>On-call schedules with rotation logic</li>
          <li>Inventory management for supplies</li>
          <li>Patient satisfaction survey analysis templates</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="prompt-examples">
        <div class="prompt-example good">

        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Marketing Copy: Finding Your Voice</h3>

      <p>
        Whether you're writing website copy, social media posts, or patient newsletters,
        AI can help you draft, refine, and maintain a consistent voice—while ensuring
        medical accuracy.
      </p>

      <div class="example-card">
        <div class="example-header">

          <li>Community event announcements</li>
          <li>Job posting descriptions</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Technical Documentation: Making Complex Things Clear</h3>

      <p>
        Need to document a process, create a training manual, or explain a technical
        system? AI can transform your rough notes into clear, organized documentation.
      </p>

      <h2>Research and Learning</h2>

      <h3>Research Synthesis: Cutting Through the Literature</h3>

      <p>
        You've already learned about AI for clinical questions. The same approach works
        for any research task—whether you're exploring a new investment, understanding
        a policy issue, or diving into a personal interest.
      </p>

      <div class="prompt-examples">

      <h3>Email Tone Adjustment: Saying It Right</h3>

      <p>
        We all draft emails that feel too harsh, too casual, or just not quite right.
        AI can help you recalibrate tone while preserving your message.
      </p>

      <div class="example-card">
        <div class="example-header">

          <li>Adding warmth to a formal communication</li>
          <li>Being assertive without being aggressive</li>
          <li>Diplomatic responses to difficult messages</li>
        </ul>

Please help me rewrite it to be firm but professional, making clear this needs to stop while maintaining a positive working relationship."</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Brainstorming and Ideation</h3>

      <p>
        Sometimes you need a thinking partner. AI is surprisingly good at generating
        ideas, offering alternative perspectives, and helping you think through complex
        decisions.
      </p>

      <div class="prompt-examples">
        <div class="prompt-example good">

      <h3>Kids' Tutoring and Homework Help</h3>

      <p>
        AI makes an excellent tutor for your children—patient, always available, and
        capable of explaining concepts multiple ways until they click. The key is using
        it to teach, not just provide answers.
      </p>

          <li>Request step-by-step walkthroughs of example problems</li>
          <li>Use it to check work and explain errors</li>
          <li>Ask for real-world applications of abstract concepts</li>

          problem-solving skills rather than dependence.

        use AI, you can create custom tools pre-loaded with your context, preferences,
        and expertise. All three major platforms offer this capability—and you don't
        need to write a single line of code.
      </p>

      <h2>Getting Started: Your First Custom Tool</h2>

      <p>
        The best way to learn is to build something useful. Here's a simple project to
        get you started.
      </p>

      <h3>Project: Personal Writing Assistant</h3>

      <p>
        Create a custom tool that edits your writing in your voice. This is useful
        because the default AI style often sounds generic—a personal assistant learns
        your preferences.
      </p>

      <div class="example-card">
        <div class="example-header">
          <span class="example-number"><i data-lucide="pen-tool"></i></span>
          <h4 class="example-title">Step-by-Step Setup</h4>
        </div>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Choose your platform:</strong> Claude Projects for document-heavy work, Gems for simplicity, Custom GPTs for advanced features.</li>
          <li><strong>Write your instructions:</strong> Start simple. Describe how you like to write, what you want preserved, and what you want improved.</li>
          <li><strong>Test with real work:</strong> Paste something you've written and see how the tool responds.</li>
          <li><strong>Refine based on results:</strong> If the output isn't quite right, adjust your instructions. This is iterative.</li>
          <li><strong>Add reference materials:</strong> (If using Claude Projects or Custom GPTs) Upload examples of writing you like—yours or others'.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

          <strong>My style preferences:</strong><br>
          - I prefer active voice over passive<br>
          - I like conversational but professional tone<br>
          - I use short sentences and short paragraphs<br>
          - I dislike corporate jargon and buzzwords<br><br>
          <strong>When editing:</strong><br>
          - Point out unclear passages and suggest specific improvements<br>
          - Flag redundant phrases<br>
          - Suggest stronger verbs when I've used weak ones<br>
          - Don't make my writing sound generic<br><br>
          <strong>Output format:</strong><br>
          - Show the edited version first<br>
          - Then list the key changes you made and why"</p>

        <p class="mb-0">
          AI isn't just for clinical work. The same tools and skills you've developed
          throughout this course apply to every aspect of your professional and personal
          life. The real power comes when you stop using generic AI and start building
          custom tools that know your context, preferences, and needs. That's when AI
          transforms from an occasional helper into a daily companion.
