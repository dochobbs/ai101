          </h3>
          <p class="news-description">
            Inaugural annual report from ARISE (AI Research and Science Evaluation), a Stanford-Harvard
            Research Network. Synthesizes developments across six themes: model performance in clinical
            reasoning, evaluation methods, technical foundations (multi-agent systems, multimodal approaches),
            human-AI workflow design, patient-facing tools with safeguards, and evidence generation through
            prospective randomized trials. Emphasizes that workflow design is as critical as model capabilities.

          </h3>
          <p class="news-description">
            The FDA released updated guidance clarifying how AI and generative AI clinical decision support (CDS)
            tools can qualify as Non-Device CDS. Key criteria: clinicians must be able to independently review
            and understand the underlying logic and data inputs, and the tool should provide a single, clinically
            appropriate recommendation. Tools meeting these criteria fall outside FDA medical device oversight,
            while AI that drives diagnosis or clinical action without adequate human oversight remains regulated.

            Anthropic announced Claude for Healthcare at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, offering
            HIPAA-ready infrastructure for enterprise customers and consumer features for Pro/Max subscribers.
            Users can connect health records via HealthEx to summarize medical history, explain test results,
            and prepare questions for appointments. Healthcare organizations gain access to integrations with
            medical databases including CMS Coverage, ICD-10, and PubMed. Health data is excluded from model
            memory and training.

            Grok AI Deepfake Crisis Prompts Global Regulatory Action
          </h3>
          <p class="news-description">
            <strong>Warning: Do not use Grok for any purpose.</strong> Elon Musk's Grok AI (integrated into X)
            has been repeatedly linked to generating non-consensual sexual deepfakes of women and minors at
            alarming scale. Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok; California's Attorney General and UK's
            Ofcom have launched investigations. The Internet Watch Foundation identified Grok-generated CSAM
            on dark-web forums. Despite restricting image generation to paid users, workarounds remain widely
            available. This reinforces our recommendation to avoid Grok entirely—there are safer, more ethical
            AI alternatives available.
