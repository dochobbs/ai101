          Why AI literacy matters for clinicians and medical learners.
        </p>
      </header>

      <h2>The Problem We're Addressing</h2>
      <p>
        AI is entering healthcare faster than medical education is adapting.
        Clinicians encounter AI tools with little framework for evaluating
        them, supervising their outputs, or understanding their failure modes.
        The result is a dangerous gap: systems deployed without adequate
        oversight, clinicians unsure when to trust AI recommendations, and
        institutions struggling to govern technology they don't fully understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        This guide addresses that gap—not by making you into an AI
        engineer, but by developing the critical thinking skills needed to
        be a sophisticated consumer and supervisor of clinical AI.
      </p>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Clinicians in practice</strong> who encounter or will soon encounter
          AI tools in their clinical work and want to use them effectively
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medical students and residents</strong> building foundational AI
          literacy as part of their training
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>APP students</strong> (PA, NP, and other advanced practice programs)
          preparing for AI-augmented practice
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Anyone in healthcare</strong> who needs to evaluate AI systems,
          explain AI to patients, or think critically about these tools
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No technical background is required. We assume clinical knowledge and
        build AI literacy on that foundation.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Philosophy</h2>

      <div class="callout callout-principle">
        <div class="callout-title">Adaptive AI Practice</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          The goal is not to master AI technology, but to become an
          <strong>adaptive practitioner</strong>—someone who can fluidly shift
          between integrating AI assistance and exercising independent
          clinical judgment, depending on the context.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        We draw a distinction between <strong>Centaur</strong> and <strong>Cyborg</strong>
        modes of human-AI collaboration. Centaurs maintain clear division of
        labor; Cyborgs integrate more seamlessly. Both have their place. The
        adaptive practitioner knows when each mode is appropriate and can
        shift between them deliberately.
      </p>

      <h2>How This Guide Works</h2>

      <h3>Self-Paced Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Work through the modules at your own speed. There are no deadlines,
        no synchronous sessions, no cohort to keep up with. Spend more time on
        topics that interest you; skim what you already know.
      </p>

      <h3>Suggested Sequence</h3>
      <p>
        The modules are ordered to build on each other: foundations first
        (how AI systems work and fail), then generative AI (large language models
        and their supervision), then governance (liability, institutional policy,
        patient communication). But feel free to jump around based on your needs.
      </p>

      <h3>Primary Sources</h3>
      <p>
        We prioritize original research over textbooks. You'll read the
        actual Obermeyer paper on algorithmic bias, the CLAIM Checklist, the
        Med-PaLM publications—not summaries of summaries. This develops the
        skill of engaging directly with research evidence.
      </p>

      <h3>Hands-On Activities</h3>
      <p>
        Most modules include practical exercises: using NotebookLM, evaluating
        AI papers, crafting prompts. The goal is to apply concepts immediately,
        not just read about them.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Guide Is Not</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Not a technical AI course.</strong> We don't teach you to
          build machine learning models. We teach you to evaluate, supervise,
          and work with them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Not a comprehensive survey.</strong> We don't cover every
          AI application in healthcare. We focus on core concepts that transfer
          across domains.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Not a vendor certification.</strong> We're not training you
          to use specific products. We're developing judgment that applies to
          any AI system you encounter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Not a credential.</strong> There are no CME credits, certificates,
          or formal assessments. The value is in what you learn, not what you earn.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Time Investment</h2>
      <p>
        Each module takes roughly <strong>2-4 hours</strong> to complete, depending
        on how deeply you engage with the readings and activities. The full guide
        represents about 30-40 hours of learning—but there's no pressure to complete
        it all. Even one or two modules will give you useful frameworks.
      </p>

      <!-- How This Course Was Made -->
      <h2>How This Course Was Made</h2>
      <p>
        This course about AI was built with AI. That's not a confession—it's the point.
      </p>

      <h3>The Process</h3>
      <p>
        Every module you've read emerged from a collaboration between a physician (me)
        and a large language model (Claude, made by Anthropic). The workflow looked
        something like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>I created an outline based on what I thought clinicians actually needed to know</li>
        <li>I wrote a detailed prompt describing the audience, tone, and learning objectives</li>
        <li>Claude generated a draft</li>
        <li>I reviewed, pushed back, asked for revisions, cut what didn't work, and added what was missing</li>
        <li>Repeat until it felt right</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Replit helped format and publish the website. The whole thing came together in
        a fraction of the time it would have taken me to write alone—and, I'd argue,
        with better results than either of us could have produced independently.
      </p>

      <h3>What This Means for You</h3>
      <p>
        This course argues that AI is a tool—powerful, useful, and only as good as
        the human directing it. The course itself is evidence of that claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        The modules exist because I knew what questions to ask, what structure would
        serve learners, and what needed to be cut or rewritten. They're better than
        what I'd have written alone because AI can draft quickly, suggest framings I
        wouldn't have considered, and maintain consistency across sections in ways that
        are tedious for humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither of us could have done this alone. Both of us were necessary.
      </p>

      <div class="callout callout-principle">
        <div class="callout-title">The Partnership Model</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          That's the partnership this course is trying to help you build with AI in your
          own work. Not replacement. Not magic. Just a capable collaborator that requires
          your judgment to be useful—and your vigilance to be safe.

      <h3>Michael Hobbs, MD</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a pediatrician and founder of Lakes Pediatrics, and I consult with health tech
        teams trying to build products that actually work for clinicians and patients. After
        25 years in practice—and advising both startups and established companies on AI—I've
        learned to translate between "startup speak" and what happens in the clinic. I watched
        healthcare fumble computers and connectivity for two decades, and I'm determined to
        help us get AI right.
