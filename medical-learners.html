          This guide addresses your specific needs as a medical student or APP student.
          You're not making independent clinical decisions yet—you're studying for high-stakes
          exams, learning to think like a clinician, and beginning supervised patient encounters.
          Your AI use cases look different from a practicing physician's, and so do your boundaries.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h2>Your Position in the AI Landscape</h2>

      <p>
        You're in a unique position. Unlike practicing clinicians who use AI to augment
        established expertise, you're simultaneously learning medicine <em>and</em> learning
        to work with AI tools. This creates both opportunity and risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The opportunity:</strong> AI can accelerate concept mastery, provide unlimited
        practice scenarios, and help you develop pattern recognition faster than previous
        generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The risk:</strong> Outsourcing your clinical reasoning before you've built it,
        developing dependencies that undermine learning, and crossing professional boundaries
        without realizing the implications.

      </div>

      <hr>

      <!-- Part 2: Safe Use Cases -->
      <h2>Part 2: Safe Use Cases for Consumer AI</h2>

      <h3>1. Concept Mastery and Deep Understanding</h3>

      <p>
        Medical school throws enormous volumes of information at you. AI excels at explaining
        complex concepts in multiple ways until something clicks.
      </p>

      <div class="prompt-example good">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="check"></i> Effective Approach</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">
"Explain the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system like I'm learning it for
the first time. Start with the trigger, walk through each step, and explain
what happens when it goes wrong. Then give me a clinical scenario where
understanding this system matters for patient care."
        </div>
        <p class="prompt-explanation">
          You're asking for progressive complexity—basic mechanism, then pathophysiology,
          then clinical relevance. This mirrors how you need to understand it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Follow-up strategy:</strong> Don't stop at the first explanation. Try:
        "Now explain it using a plumbing system analogy, then point out where the analogy
        breaks down and why." Forcing the AI to use analogies and then critique them helps
        you understand conceptual boundaries.
      </p>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Watch For This</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Using AI to simply look up facts you should memorize. If you're asking "What are
          the branches of the facial nerve?" repeatedly without engaging deeper, you're
          creating a dependency rather than building knowledge.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>2. Exam Preparation (USMLE, COMLEX, PANCE, SHELF Exams)</h3>

      <p>
        AI can generate practice questions, explain answer rationales, and help you identify
        knowledge gaps. But commercial question banks (UWorld, AMBOSS, Rosh Review) remain
        superior for actual test prep because they're calibrated to exam format and difficulty.
      </p>

      <div class="prompt-example good">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="check"></i> Effective Use</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">
"I'm studying renal physiology for Step 1. Create 3 clinical vignettes
testing my understanding of different types of renal tubular acidosis.
Make them progressively harder. After I answer each one, explain the
reasoning behind the correct answer and why the wrong answers are
tempting but incorrect."
        </div>
        <p class="prompt-explanation">
          You're using AI for active recall practice with immediate feedback. The meta-cognitive
          element ("why are wrong answers tempting") helps you understand your own reasoning errors.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="prompt-example best">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="star"></i> Better for Weak Areas</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">
"I keep missing questions about heart failure management. Give me a
framework for approaching any heart failure question—what should I
always ask myself first, second, third? Then create 2 questions that
test different parts of this framework."
        </div>
        <p class="prompt-explanation">
          You're not just drilling facts; you're building clinical reasoning scaffolding.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Strategy note:</strong> Use commercial QBanks for the bulk of practice—they
        know how to write test questions. Use AI for supplementary exploration of concepts
        you're struggling with, for building frameworks, and for understanding why you're
        getting things wrong.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Clinical Reasoning Practice</h3>

      <p>
        Before you have real patients, you need to practice thinking through cases. AI can
        generate unlimited scenarios and walk through diagnostic reasoning with you.
      </p>

      <div class="prompt-example good">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="check"></i> Structured Approach</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">
"Give me a clinical vignette of a 45-year-old presenting to primary care
with fatigue. Don't tell me the diagnosis yet. I'll work through my
differential, ask for additional history and exam findings, and propose
initial workup. After each step, give me the information I asked for and
let me reason through it."
        </div>
        <p class="prompt-explanation">
          This simulates the actual cognitive process of seeing a patient. You're practicing
          information gathering, synthesis, and decision-making.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="prompt-example best">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="star"></i> Advanced Version</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">
"Same scenario, but this time point out when I'm asking for unnecessary
tests, missing key history elements, or jumping to conclusions without
adequate reasoning. Critique my clinical thinking process."
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Important Boundary</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          This is practice for learning, not clinical decision-making. If you're on clinical
          rotations and thinking about an actual patient, you discuss with your preceptor,
          not an AI. The moment it's real patient care, even as supervised practice, consumer
          AI isn't the right tool for decision support.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>4. Literature Comprehension</h3>

      <p>
        You'll encounter research papers in coursework and need to understand study design,
        statistics, and clinical implications. AI can help decode dense methodology sections
        and statistical analyses.
      </p>

      <div class="prompt-example good">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="check"></i> For Understanding Statistics</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">
"This paper reports a hazard ratio of 0.73 (95% CI 0.61-0.88, p=0.001)
for the primary outcome. Walk me through what this actually means—the
effect size, the certainty, and how I should interpret this clinically."
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>What to verify:</strong> Always read the actual paper's conclusions yourself.
        AI can miss nuance, context, or limitations the authors discuss. Use it to understand
        methodology, not to replace critical reading.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Differential Diagnosis Development</h3>

      <p>
        Learning to generate comprehensive differential diagnoses is a core skill. AI can
        help you practice this systematically.
      </p>

      <div class="prompt-example good">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="check"></i> Framework-Building</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">
"For a patient presenting with acute dyspnea, help me build a systematic
differential using an anatomical/system-based approach. Start with
life-threatening causes, then move through cardiac, pulmonary, and other
systems. For each category, explain what history or exam findings would
point me toward or away from these diagnoses."
        </div>
        <p class="prompt-explanation">
          You're learning a systematic framework (life-threatening first, then by system)
          rather than just getting a list. This builds the cognitive scaffolding you'll
          use in actual practice.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>6. Practical Procedure Preparation</h3>

      <p>
        Before your first venipuncture, intubation, or lumbar puncture, you can use AI to
        mentally rehearse steps, anticipate complications, and understand anatomy.
      </p>

      <div class="prompt-example good">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="check"></i> Mental Rehearsal</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">
"I'm about to perform my first lumbar puncture tomorrow. Walk me through:
(1) how to position the patient and why, (2) the anatomical landmarks and
how to find them, (3) step-by-step technique, (4) what can go wrong and
how to recognize it, (5) what I should do if I'm not getting CSF. Make it
practical—things I need to know in the moment."
        </div>
        <p class="prompt-explanation">
          You're mentally rehearsing the procedure, which improves actual performance.
          But you're not replacing hands-on teaching or simulation training.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Remember:</strong> This supplements formal training; it doesn't replace it.
        You still need direct supervision, simulation practice, and hands-on teaching. AI
        gives you mental framework, not motor skills.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Personal Statements and Professional Development</h3>

      <p>
        AI can help you refine personal statements, prepare for interviews, and develop
        your professional narrative.
      </p>

      <div class="prompt-example good">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="check"></i> Editorial Assistance</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">
"I'm writing a personal statement for residency applications in pediatrics.
Here's my draft [paste]. Help me identify: (1) where I'm telling instead of
showing, (2) cliches I should remove, (3) places where I could add specific
details that make it more memorable, (4) whether my motivation for pediatrics
comes through clearly."
        </div>
        <p class="prompt-explanation">
          You're using AI as an editorial assistant, not a ghostwriter. You wrote the
          content; AI helps you refine it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-principle">
        <div class="callout-title">A Note on Authenticity</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Programs are looking for your voice, your experiences, your reasoning. AI-generated
          content from scratch tends to be generic and often detectable. Use AI for editing
          and refinement, not for creation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <hr>

      <!-- Part 3: Professional Boundaries -->
      <h2>Part 3: Thinking About Professional Boundaries</h2>

      <p>
        As you develop as a clinician, you're also developing professional judgment—knowing
        when to use which resources, when to seek supervision, and how to handle patient
        information responsibly.
      </p>

      <h3>When Does Learning Become Patient Care?</h3>

      <p><strong>The core question:</strong> Are you making decisions about what to actually
      do for a real patient, or are you learning concepts?</p>

      <div class="example-comparison">
        <div class="example-box said">
          <h4><i data-lucide="check-circle"></i> Learning (Consumer AI Appropriate)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>"Explain the diagnostic approach to acute kidney injury"</li>
            <li>"What's the pathophysiology of different types of AKI?"</li>
            <li>"Walk me through how to interpret FENa and why it matters"</li>
            <li>"I saw a patient with AKI today. Help me understand the underlying mechanisms better" (no identifiers)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="example-box generated">
          <h4><i data-lucide="x-circle"></i> Clinical Decision-Making (Discuss with Your Team)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>"My patient has these specific findings—what should I order next?"</li>
            <li>"Should I start this medication for my patient?"</li>
            <li>"What's the right diagnosis for this case I'm working up?"</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4>The Gray Zone: Preparing for Rounds</h4>

      <p>
        You're going to present a patient with AKI tomorrow. You want to make sure you
        understand the concepts before discussing with your team. Using AI to review AKI
        management in general? That's learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        But remember: your preceptor expects to teach you, expects you to ask questions,
        and expects your clinical reasoning to reflect your own thinking (even if you've
        studied). The goal is to participate meaningfully in supervision, not to outsource
        your reasoning and present it as your own.
      </p>

      <div class="callout callout-principle">
        <div class="callout-title">The Principle</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Consumer AI doesn't replace clinical supervision. Use it to understand concepts
          better so you can engage more thoughtfully with your preceptors, not to bypass
          that supervision.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Handling Patient Information</h3>

      <p>
        You'll naturally want to learn from the patients you see. The question is how to
        do that while respecting privacy and building good habits.
      </p>

      <h4>What Makes Information Identifiable?</h4>

      <p>
        It's not just name and medical record number. The combination of demographics,
        specific clinical details, and timing can identify someone, especially in smaller
        communities or for unusual presentations.
      </p>

      <h4>Safe Approaches for Learning from Your Cases</h4>

      <div class="prompt-example bad">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="x"></i> Instead of This</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">

unusual maculopapular rash on her legs and trunk that started 3 days ago.
What could it be?"
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="prompt-example good">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="check"></i> Try This</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">
"What causes maculopapular rash in patients with diabetes? What should I

      <div class="prompt-example best">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="star"></i> Or Even Better (After Discussing with Your Team)</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">
"I saw a case of [diagnosis] today. Help me understand the pathophysiology
so I can remember this for next time."
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Building habits now about how you discuss cases
        shapes habits that will last your entire career. Patients trust you with intimate
        details about their lives and health. That trust is worth protecting, not because
        of fear of consequences, but because it's fundamental to the physician-patient
        relationship.
      </p>

      <h3>Academic Integrity Considerations</h3>

      <p>
        You're evaluated on your clinical reasoning, your writing, your understanding.
        Using AI to help you learn is different from using it to do the work for you.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Think about it this way:</strong></p>

      <p>
        If your ethics course asks you to reflect on a challenging patient interaction,
        the value is in <em>your</em> reflection—your thinking about what made it challenging,
        what you learned, how you'd approach it differently. Having AI write that reflection
        defeats the entire purpose of the assignment.
      </p>

      <p>
        But asking AI "I want to write about informed consent challenges in pediatrics—help
        me organize my argument" when you've already done the thinking? That's using a tool
        appropriately.
      </p>

      <div class="callout callout-question">
        <div class="callout-title">The Test</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Would you be comfortable telling your professor or course director exactly how
          you used AI for this assignment? If yes, you're probably fine. If you'd have to
          hide it or be vague about it, reconsider.

      <h3>Workflow 2: Preparing for Clinical Rotations</h3>

      <div class="example-comparison">
        <div class="example-box said">
          <h4><i data-lucide="sunrise"></i> Before Rotation Starts</h4>
          <p>
            "I'm starting my surgery rotation. I need to know: (1) common operations I'll see,
            (2) basic anatomy I must know cold, (3) typical questions I'll be asked on rounds,
            (4) what I should read the night before common cases."
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="example-box said">
          <h4><i data-lucide="sunset"></i> During Rotation (Evening Review)</h4>
          <p>
            After rounds: "Today I was asked about the blood supply to the pancreas and didn't
            know it. Teach me this in a way I'll remember."
          </p>
          <p>
            Evening: "I saw a case of acute cholecystitis today. Help me understand the
            pathophysiology and standard management so I can learn from this case."
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>The distinction:</strong> Learning about clinical topics to prepare yourself
        is different from making decisions about actual patients. The first enhances your
        ability to participate in supervised care; the second bypasses that supervision.
      </p>

      <h3>Workflow 3: Preparing Case Presentations</h3>

      <p><strong>Thoughtful approach:</strong></p>

      <p>
        Write your presentation first—your history, your physical exam findings, your
        assessment, your differential, your plan. This is your clinical thinking.
      </p>

      <p>Then, if helpful:</p>

      <div class="prompt-example good">
        <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="check"></i> Polish and Prepare</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">
"I'm presenting a case of community-acquired pneumonia. Here's my structure
[outline]. Am I missing any key elements? Is my reasoning clear? What
questions might I get asked and how should I prepare?"
        </div>
        <p class="prompt-explanation">
          You've done the clinical work. AI helps you polish the presentation and anticipate
          teaching questions, similar to how you might ask a senior resident "what do you
          think they'll ask me about?"
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Part 6: Developing AI Literacy -->
      <h2>Part 6: Developing AI Literacy Alongside Clinical Skills</h2>

      <p>
        You're learning to be a clinician in the AI era. This means developing parallel
        competencies.
      </p>

      <h3>Skill 1: Prompt Engineering for Learning</h3>

      <div class="prompt-examples">
        <div class="prompt-example bad">
          <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="x"></i> Vague</div>
          <p>"Tell me about heart failure"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="prompt-example good">
          <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="check"></i> Specific</div>
          <p>"Explain the pathophysiology of systolic vs diastolic heart failure, focusing on what causes each and how this explains different exam findings"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="prompt-example best">
          <div class="prompt-label"><i data-lucide="star"></i> Targeted at Your Gap</div>
          <p>"I understand the Frank-Starling curve but don't understand how it breaks down in heart failure. Explain this, then show me how it explains why we use specific medications"</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Skill 2: Critical Verification</h3>

      <p>
        Treat AI output like a consult note from a colleague you don't know well—potentially
        useful, but verify everything important.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Practice this:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ask AI a clinical question</li>
        <li>Verify the answer in UpToDate, a textbook, or primary literature</li>
        <li>Note discrepancies</li>
        <li>Understand why the discrepancy occurred</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This builds your ability to spot AI hallucinations and reinforces that AI is a
        starting point, not an endpoint.
      </p>

      <h3>Skill 3: Recognizing Appropriate Use Boundaries</h3>

      <p>Build a personal decision tree:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does this involve an actual patient's care? → Discuss with my team</li>
        <li>Am I trying to learn something? → Consumer AI likely fine</li>
        <li>Would my attending expect me to ask them instead? → Ask them, not AI</li>
        <li>Am I using AI to avoid thinking? → Stop and think first</li>
        <li>Will this help me learn or just get the answer? → Former is good, latter is problematic</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Skill 4: Integrating AI into Clinical Reasoning</h3>

      <p>AI should enhance your clinical thinking, not replace it. Test this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Before AI:</strong> Spend 5 minutes thinking through a clinical question yourself</li>
        <li><strong>After AI:</strong> Compare your reasoning to AI's response</li>
        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> What did you get right? What did you miss? <em>Why</em> did you miss it?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This metacognitive practice—thinking about your thinking—is how you improve
        clinical reasoning.

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <h2>Conclusion: Building Your Practice</h2>

      <p>
        You're learning medicine at a unique time. AI will be part of your practice for
        your entire career, but its role will evolve. What won't change: your responsibility
        to patients, your commitment to lifelong learning, and your professional judgment.
      </p>

      <p>Start now by building thoughtful habits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use AI deliberately, not reflexively</li>
        <li>Always know why you're using it and what you're trying to learn</li>
        <li>Verify information before you rely on it</li>
        <li>Think carefully about professional boundaries</li>
        <li>Keep developing your own clinical reasoning</li>
        <li>Seek human mentorship and supervision</li>
        <li>Reflect regularly on whether AI is enhancing or undermining your learning</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The clinicians who will thrive in the coming decades aren't those who avoid AI or
        those who depend on it uncritically. They're the ones who integrate it thoughtfully
        into their practice while maintaining the core competencies, professional judgment,
        and human connection that define excellent medicine.
      </p>

      <p>You're building that practice now. Make it intentional.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Final Note</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Consume resources selectively. You don't need to become an AI expert. You need to
          be an excellent clinician who uses AI thoughtfully. Spend 90% of your time learning
          medicine. Spend 10% learning to use tools (including AI) that help you learn medicine better.
