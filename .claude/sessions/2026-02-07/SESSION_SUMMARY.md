## Accomplishments

### AI Off Call Webinar Series Design
- Brainstormed and designed a 4-session co-branded webinar series with Offcall (offcall.com)
- Researched Offcall's platform, audience, and content style
- Designed complete session plans using parallel agents (one per session):
  - **Session 1: "Your First AI Shift"** — Skeptic → User (CRAFT framework)
  - **Session 2: "The AI Toolkit"** — User → Evaluator (CRAFT Rubric + Personal Toolkit)
  - **Session 3: "AI Without the Hype"** — Evaluator → Leader (SHIELD framework)
  - **Session 4: "The Vibe Code Session"** — Leader → Builder (Builder's Ladder)
- Each session includes: story opener, live demo plan, interactive lab, framework, Q&A
- Documented build requirements, pre/post-session materials, CME objectives, success metrics
- Full design written to `docs/plans/2026-02-07-ai-off-call-series-design.md` (968 lines)

### Vibe Coding Module Update (v1.1 → v1.2)
- Researched current vibe coding landscape (February 2026)
- Added "The February 2026 Moment" callout (Codex macOS app, GPT-5.3-Codex, Opus 4.6, C compiler demo)
- Updated Claude Code section with Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.5 capabilities
- Added OpenAI Codex App to tool comparison section
- Updated Replit ($100M ARR) and Lovable ($100M ARR) growth numbers
- Added "Listen Before You Build" podcast callout (NLW "How to Learn AI With AI")
- Added "Vibe Coding in Healthcare" callout (BioData Mining paper, HIPAA warning)
- Added "The Open Source Tension" to pitfalls section
- Updated cultural references (Collins WOTY 2025, Wikipedia, 41% AI-generated code stat)
- Updated time references throughout (late 2025 → early 2026)
- Ran full link check on all 28 URLs — all valid

## Commits Made
- `4275009`: FEATURE: Update vibe coding module and add AI Off Call series design

## Issues Encountered
- Could not find transcript for NLW "How to Learn AI With AI" episode (too recent, Feb 8 2026)
- Simon Willison URL had DNS resolution issue from local machine but verified live via WebFetch

## Decisions Made
- Offcall series: 4 sessions (not 3), monthly cadence, co-hosted format
- Session format: Story (5 min) + Live Demo (15 min) + Lab (10 min) + Framework (10 min) + Q&A (15-20 min)
- Renamed "The Game" to "The Lab" for professional tone
- Vibe coding update: skipped adding Cursor as a featured tool, skipped podcast section updates for now
- Used parallel agents (4 simultaneous) for session design work

## Next Steps
- Build webinar assets (lab web apps, PDF handouts, polling infrastructure)
- Add remaining podcast updates to vibe coding page when ready
- Consider adding Cursor to tool landscape in future update
- Review other AI 101 pages for similar freshness updates
- Continue domain setup work (DNS, GitHub Pages)
