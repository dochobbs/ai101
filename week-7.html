      <div class="callout callout-question">
        <div class="callout-title">Core Question</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          How should clinicians think about dividing cognitive labor with AI—and 
          what are the risks of getting this wrong?
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The terms "centaur" and "cyborg" come from chess, where human-AI teams 
        competed after computers surpassed individual humans. <strong>Centaurs</strong> 
        maintain a clear division of labor—human does strategy, computer does 
        calculation. <strong>Cyborgs</strong> integrate more seamlessly, with 
        the boundary between human and machine cognition becoming blurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both models have clinical applications. A centaur approach might mean 
        using AI to generate differential diagnoses while the physician makes 
        final decisions. A cyborg approach might mean using AI-assisted 
        documentation that shapes how the physician thinks about the case in 
        real-time. This week explores the trade-offs.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

      <h3>Adaptive AI Practice</h3>
      <p>
        The goal isn't to pick one mode and stick with it—it's to develop the 
        judgment to shift between centaur and cyborg modes depending on context. 
        Routine tasks may benefit from seamless integration; high-stakes decisions 
        may require clearer separation and deliberate oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
        This requires metacognition: awareness of your own cognitive process and 
        when AI assistance is helping versus when it might be introducing bias 
        or premature closure.
      </p>

      <h3>The Deskilling Risk</h3>
      <p>
        If clinicians offload cognitive tasks to AI, will they lose the underlying 
        skills? The concern isn't hypothetical—studies of GPS navigation show 
        measurable impacts on spatial reasoning. In medicine, if trainees never 
        practice differential diagnosis without AI assistance, will they develop 
        the pattern recognition needed to catch AI errors?
      </p>
      <p>
        Counter-arguments exist: calculators didn't destroy mathematical reasoning, 
        and AI might free cognitive resources for higher-order clinical thinking. 
        The truth likely depends on how AI is integrated into training and practice.
      </p>

      <h3>Trust Calibration</h3>
      <p>
        Optimal AI use requires calibrated trust—neither blind acceptance nor 
        reflexive rejection. Clinicians need to develop intuitions about when 
        AI is likely reliable and when to be skeptical. This is a learned skill, 
        built through experience with AI successes and failures.
      </p>

        <div class="callout-title">The Adaptive Practitioner</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          "The goal of AI literacy is not to make you a machine learning expert. 
          It's to make you an <em>adaptive practitioner</em>—someone who can 
          fluidly shift between integrating AI assistance and stepping back to 
          exercise independent clinical judgment."

        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Think of a clinical task you do regularly. Would you approach it as 
            a "centaur" (clear human-AI division) or "cyborg" (seamless integration)? 
            Why?
          </li>
          <li>
            How should medical education adapt if trainees will use AI throughout 
            their careers? Should we require "AI-free" training periods?
          </li>
          <li>
            A senior physician says "I've been doing this for 30 years, I don't 
            need an AI second-guessing me." How would you respond?
