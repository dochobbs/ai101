        <div class="callout-title">Core Question</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          What do patients need to know about AI in their care—and how do we 
          explain it in ways that are honest without being alarming?
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Patients are increasingly aware that AI is entering healthcare, but 
        their understanding varies wildly—from science fiction fears to 
        unrealistic expectations of infallibility. This week addresses the 
        communication challenges: when to disclose AI use, how to explain it, 
        and how to obtain meaningful informed consent for AI-assisted care.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

      <h3>The Disclosure Debate</h3>
      <p>
        Should patients be told every time AI influences their care? Arguments 
        exist on both sides:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>For disclosure:</strong> Patients have a right to know what 
          tools affect their care; transparency builds trust; some patients 
          may have strong preferences about AI use.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Against routine disclosure:</strong> AI is increasingly 
          pervasive (do we disclose every software system?); disclosure may 
          cause unnecessary anxiety; patients may lack context to meaningfully 
          evaluate AI use.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A middle path: disclose AI use when it materially affects clinical 
        decisions, when patients specifically ask, or when AI is the primary 
        diagnostic or treatment recommendation (not just a supporting tool).
      </p>

      <h3>Informed Consent Frameworks</h3>
      <p>
        Traditional informed consent requires explaining risks, benefits, and 
        alternatives. For AI, this might include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What the AI does and what data it uses</li>
        <li>The AI's accuracy and error rates, if known</li>
        <li>How the clinician uses AI output (supporting tool vs. primary driver)</li>
        <li>Options if the patient prefers care without AI involvement</li>
        <li>How patient data may be used for AI improvement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Practically, this can't be a 10-minute conversation for every AI 
        encounter. Institutions may need tiered approaches: general consent 
        covering routine AI use, specific consent for high-stakes AI decisions.
      </p>

      <h3>Managing Expectations</h3>
      <p>
        Some patients will expect AI to be infallible ("the computer must be 
        right"). Others will distrust AI entirely ("I want a human doctor"). 
        Effective communication navigates both:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI is a tool that helps me provide better care, not a replacement for my judgment</li>
        <li>AI can catch things I might miss, but it can also make mistakes—that's why I review its suggestions</li>
        <li>You're always welcome to ask about how I'm using AI in your care</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout callout-principle">
        <div class="callout-title">Communication Principle</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Patients don't need to understand how algorithms work—but they do 
          need to understand that you, their clinician, remain responsible 
          for their care and are thoughtfully supervising any AI tools involved.
        </p>

      <h2>Sample Disclosure Language</h2>
      
      <h3>Routine AI Use (Brief Mention)</h3>
      <div class="prompt-box">"I'm using a computer tool that helps me review your 
images/lab results. It flags things for me to look at 
more closely. I always review its suggestions myself 
before making any decisions about your care."</div>

      <h3>AI-Driven Recommendation (More Detail)</h3>
      <div class="prompt-box">"A computer analysis of your scan suggests [finding]. 
These tools are helpful but not perfect—they can miss 
things and sometimes flag things that turn out to be 
nothing. I've reviewed the results and here's what I 
think we should do..."</div>

      <h3>Response to Patient Concern</h3>
      <div class="prompt-box">"I understand you have concerns about AI. You should 
know that I make all the final decisions about your 
care. The AI helps me by processing large amounts of 
data, but I always apply my clinical judgment. If you 
prefer, we can discuss specifically how AI is being 
used in your care."</div>

      <div class="discussion-questions">
        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A patient says "I don't want any AI involved in my care." 
            How do you respond? Is this request even feasible given 
            how integrated AI is becoming?
          </li>
          <li>
            Should there be different disclosure standards for AI that 
            diagnoses (high stakes) vs. AI that drafts documentation 
            (lower stakes)?
          </li>
          <li>
            A patient's family member asks "Was a computer involved in 
            the decision that led to this outcome?" after a poor result. 
            How do you answer?
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
